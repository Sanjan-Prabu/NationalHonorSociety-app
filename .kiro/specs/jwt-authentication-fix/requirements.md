# JWT Authentication Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical JWT authentication issues in the React Native app including refresh token errors, session persistence problems, profile button functionality issues, and provides clarity on password storage security. The goal is to create a robust, secure authentication system that maintains user sessions across app restarts and provides consistent profile access throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: JWT Token Management and Refresh

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to persist reliably without encountering "Invalid Refresh Token" errors, so that I can use the app seamlessly without frequent re-authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store both access and refresh tokens securely using AsyncStorage
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the stored refresh token
3. WHEN a refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and redirect to login
4. WHEN the app is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the user session from stored tokens
5. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data and show appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Session Persistence with AsyncStorage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remain logged in when I close and reopen the app, so that I don't have to enter my credentials every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL persist the session data to AsyncStorage
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL check AsyncStorage for existing valid session data
3. WHEN valid session data exists THEN the system SHALL restore the user session automatically
4. WHEN session data is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL clear it and require fresh login
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data from AsyncStorage

### Requirement 3: Profile Button Functionality Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want the profile button to work consistently on all screens and after logout/login cycles, so that I can access my profile and logout functionality reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the profile button THEN the profile modal SHALL open immediately
2. WHEN a user logs out and logs back in THEN the profile button SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN the profile modal is open THEN it SHALL display correct user information
4. WHEN a user taps logout in the profile modal THEN the system SHALL log them out and redirect to login screen
5. WHEN the profile button is pressed on any screen THEN it SHALL show the same consistent profile modal

### Requirement 4: Universal Profile Button Access

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the profile button and logout functionality from any screen in the app, so that I have consistent access to my account controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any authenticated screen THEN the profile button SHALL be visible and accessible
2. WHEN a user taps the profile button from any screen THEN it SHALL show the same profile modal with logout option
3. WHEN a user logs out from any screen THEN they SHALL be redirected to the login screen
4. WHEN the profile modal opens THEN it SHALL display consistent styling and functionality across all screens
5. WHEN a user cancels the profile modal THEN they SHALL return to their previous screen

### Requirement 5: Password Security and Admin Access Clarification

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to understand how user passwords are stored and how I can manage user accounts securely, so that I can maintain proper security practices and user management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are stored THEN they SHALL be hashed using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt/scrypt)
2. WHEN an admin needs to reset a user password THEN they SHALL use Supabase admin functions, not direct database access
3. WHEN password reset is required THEN the system SHALL provide secure password reset functionality
4. WHEN admin access is needed THEN clear documentation SHALL explain proper user management procedures
5. IF password recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide email-based password reset functionality

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear, helpful error messages when authentication issues occur, so that I understand what's happening and how to resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific, user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate connectivity error messages
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL explain that re-login is required
4. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL notify the user before redirecting to login
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging while protecting user privacy

### Requirement 7: Secure Token Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication tokens to be stored securely on my device, so that my account remains protected even if my device is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL use secure storage mechanisms (Expo SecureStore for sensitive data)
2. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN all stored authentication data SHALL be automatically removed
3. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN they SHALL use HTTPS and proper headers
4. WHEN storing session data THEN sensitive information SHALL be encrypted
5. WHEN tokens expire THEN they SHALL be automatically removed from storage
