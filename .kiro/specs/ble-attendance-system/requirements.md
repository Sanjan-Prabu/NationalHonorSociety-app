# BLE Attendance System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a native Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) attendance system for the National Honor Society (NHS) and National Honor Society of Arts (NHSA) React Native application. The system will enable officers to broadcast attendance sessions via BLE beacons and allow members to automatically check in when in proximity to the beacon.

## Glossary

- **BLE_System**: The complete Bluetooth Low Energy attendance tracking system
- **Officer_Device**: Mobile device operated by an NHS/NHSA officer with broadcasting capabilities
- **Member_Device**: Mobile device operated by an NHS/NHSA member with scanning capabilities
- **Attendance_Session**: A time-bounded event where officers broadcast a beacon for member check-ins
- **Session_Token**: A unique identifier for each attendance session (â‰ˆ12 characters)
- **Beacon_Payload**: BLE advertisement data containing organization code and session token
- **EAS_Dev_Client**: Expo Application Services development client for testing native modules
- **Organization_Context**: NHS or NHSA organization isolation maintained via existing RLS

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an NHS/NHSA officer, I want to start a BLE attendance session for meetings and events, so that members can automatically check in when they arrive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an officer creates an attendance session, THE BLE_System SHALL generate a unique Session_Token
2. WHEN an officer starts broadcasting, THE Officer_Device SHALL advertise the Session_Token via BLE beacon
3. WHEN an attendance session is active, THE BLE_System SHALL maintain organization isolation per existing RLS policies
4. WHERE the session has a time-to-live parameter, THE BLE_System SHALL automatically expire sessions after the specified duration
5. WHILE broadcasting is active, THE Officer_Device SHALL continue advertising until manually stopped or session expires

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an NHS/NHSA member, I want my device to automatically detect nearby attendance sessions, so that I can check in without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Member_Device is within BLE range of an active session, THE BLE_System SHALL detect the Beacon_Payload
2. WHEN a valid Session_Token is detected, THE BLE_System SHALL automatically submit attendance for the member
3. WHILE scanning for beacons, THE Member_Device SHALL filter for the member's organization context only
4. IF a member is not authorized for the detected organization, THEN THE BLE_System SHALL reject the attendance submission
5. WHEN attendance is successfully recorded, THE BLE_System SHALL provide confirmation to the member

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the BLE attendance system to integrate with existing Supabase infrastructure, so that attendance data maintains consistency with current security and data models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance sessions are created, THE BLE_System SHALL use existing attendance and events tables
2. WHEN session tokens are generated, THE BLE_System SHALL ensure uniqueness across all organizations
3. WHILE processing attendance, THE BLE_System SHALL enforce existing Row-Level Security policies
4. WHERE attendance data is stored, THE BLE_System SHALL maintain referential integrity with existing foreign key constraints
5. WHEN BLE operations occur, THE BLE_System SHALL log activities for monitoring and debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the BLE system to work with Expo EAS development clients, so that native BLE functionality can be tested and deployed without ejecting from Expo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application, THE BLE_System SHALL integrate with Expo's custom native module system
2. WHEN testing BLE functionality, THE EAS_Dev_Client SHALL support both Android and iOS native BLE operations
3. WHILE maintaining Expo compatibility, THE BLE_System SHALL use platform-specific native APIs (BluetoothLeAdvertiser for Android, CBPeripheralManager for iOS)
4. WHERE permissions are required, THE BLE_System SHALL handle Android 12+ and iOS 16+ permission models
5. WHEN deploying to production, THE BLE_System SHALL work with standard Expo build processes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the BLE attendance system to handle permissions and errors gracefully, so that the app remains stable and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BLE permissions are missing, THE BLE_System SHALL request appropriate permissions with clear explanations
2. WHEN Bluetooth is disabled, THE BLE_System SHALL provide actionable guidance to enable Bluetooth
3. IF BLE hardware is unsupported, THEN THE BLE_System SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user
4. WHILE BLE operations are in progress, THE BLE_System SHALL provide real-time status updates
5. WHEN errors occur, THE BLE_System SHALL log detailed information for troubleshooting while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want BLE attendance data to be secure and prevent unauthorized access, so that attendance records maintain integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Session_Tokens are generated, THE BLE_System SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
2. WHEN BLE payloads are transmitted, THE BLE_System SHALL include only necessary data (organization code and session token)
3. WHILE sessions are active, THE BLE_System SHALL validate session expiration server-side
4. WHERE attendance is recorded, THE BLE_System SHALL verify member authorization for the specific organization
5. WHEN processing BLE data, THE BLE_System SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
