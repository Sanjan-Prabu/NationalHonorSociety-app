# Navigation System Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete role-based authentication and navigation architecture for the National Honor Society / National Honor Society Associated (NHS/NHSA) React Native app. The system must implement a comprehensive auth flow starting with a landing screen that routes users to role-specific login/signup flows, followed by separate bottom tab navigators for officers and members.

The navigation system will replace any existing navigation structure and provide a production-ready, scalable foundation that supports both NHS and NHSA organizations with distinct member and officer experiences. The implementation must use only dependencies already present in package.json (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/native-stack, @expo/vector-icons, react-native-vector-icons) and follow the FRC 2658 navigation patterns while integrating with the existing Supabase authentication and NativeWind styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Landing Screen and Role Selection

**User Story:** As a user opening the app, I want to see a landing screen with clear options to identify myself as either a member or officer, so that I can access the appropriate authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app opens for the first time THEN it SHALL display a LandingScreen with two buttons: "I'm a Member" and "I'm an Officer"
2. WHEN a user taps "I'm a Member" THEN they SHALL navigate to LoginScreen with { role: 'member' } parameter
3. WHEN a user taps "I'm an Officer" THEN they SHALL navigate to LoginScreen with { role: 'officer' } parameter
4. WHEN the landing screen is displayed THEN it SHALL use the existing styling patterns with LinearGradient and NativeWind
5. WHEN implementing the landing screen THEN it SHALL be accessible with proper screen reader support and touch targets

### Requirement 2: Shared Authentication Screens

**User Story:** As a user, I want a shared login and signup experience that adapts based on my selected role, so that the authentication process is consistent but role-appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LoginScreen receives a role parameter THEN it SHALL display "Sign up" button that navigates to SignupScreen with the same role
2. WHEN LoginScreen receives signupSuccess: true parameter THEN it SHALL display a success toast message
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL fetch their profile from Supabase and navigate to the appropriate root based on their stored role
4. WHEN login is successful and user role is 'officer' THEN navigation SHALL reset to OfficerRoot
5. WHEN login is successful and user role is 'member' THEN navigation SHALL reset to MemberRoot
6. WHEN using navigation.reset() THEN users SHALL NOT be able to navigate back to auth screens after login

### Requirement 3: Signup Flow with Role-Based Security

**User Story:** As a user signing up, I want a secure registration process that prevents unauthorized officer role assignment, so that only legitimate officers can access administrative features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SignupScreen receives role parameter THEN it SHALL create auth user and profile but NOT auto-sign-in the user
2. WHEN role === 'officer' during signup THEN the system SHALL require an invite-code flow OR create profile with role: 'member' and pending_officer: true
3. WHEN signup is successful THEN user SHALL navigate back to LoginScreen with { role, signupSuccess: true } parameters
4. WHEN clients attempt to self-assign officer role THEN the system SHALL prevent this through server-side validation
5. WHEN implementing officer signup THEN it SHALL use Supabase RPC verify_officer_invite() for secure server-side validation
6. WHEN signup fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to guide the user

### Requirement 4: Root Navigation Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear navigation architecture that switches between authentication and main app flows, so that the app state is properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing RootNavigator THEN it SHALL use NavigationContainer with session state management
2. WHEN user is not authenticated THEN RootNavigator SHALL render auth stack (Landing, Login, Signup screens)
3. WHEN user is authenticated THEN RootNavigator SHALL render either OfficerRoot or MemberRoot based on user role
4. WHEN session changes THEN navigation SHALL automatically update without manual intervention
5. WHEN implementing navigation types THEN it SHALL use TypeScript with RootStackParamList, OfficerTabParamList, and MemberTabParamList
6. WHEN navigation is complete THEN it SHALL include proper error boundaries and loading states

### Requirement 5: Officer Bottom Tab Navigator

**User Story:** As an officer, I want access to comprehensive management features through a dedicated bottom tab navigation, so that I can efficiently administer NHS/NHSA operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an officer logs in THEN they SHALL see OfficerBottomNavigator with tabs: OfficerDashboard, OfficerAnnouncements, OfficerAttendance, OfficerVerifyHours, OfficerEvents
2. WHEN implementing officer tabs THEN each tab SHALL link to appropriate officer screen files in /screens/officer/nhs/ directory
3. WHEN officer screens are missing THEN placeholder screens SHALL be created with TODO documentation
4. WHEN officers navigate THEN all tabs SHALL be accessible and properly themed with @expo/vector-icons
5. WHEN implementing officer navigation THEN it SHALL use createBottomTabNavigator with headerShown: false
6. WHEN officer tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent icon mapping and theme-aware colors

### Requirement 6: Member Bottom Tab Navigator

**User Story:** As a member, I want access to core NHS/NHSA features through an intuitive bottom tab navigation, so that I can efficiently complete my activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member logs in THEN they SHALL see MemberBottomNavigator with tabs: Dashboard, Announcements, Attendance, LogHours, Events
2. WHEN implementing member tabs THEN each tab SHALL link to appropriate member screen files in /screens/member/nhs/ directory
3. WHEN member screens are missing THEN placeholder screens SHALL be created with TODO documentation
4. WHEN members navigate THEN all tabs SHALL be accessible and properly themed with @expo/vector-icons
5. WHEN implementing member navigation THEN it SHALL use createBottomTabNavigator with headerShown: false
6. WHEN member tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent icon mapping and theme-aware colors

### Requirement 7: Role Protection and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust role-based access control that prevents unauthorized access to officer features, so that the app maintains security and proper permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing role protection THEN officer-only screens SHALL redirect members to MemberRoot with error toast
2. WHEN a user attempts to access unauthorized screens THEN they SHALL see "Access denied" message and be redirected appropriately
3. WHEN implementing role checks THEN the system SHALL use useRequireRole hook or HOC for screen-level protection
4. WHEN roles are checked THEN the system SHALL always fetch current user profile and store role in app state
5. WHEN role information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL default to most restrictive (member) permissions
6. WHEN implementing access control THEN it SHALL be enforced at both navigator-level and individual screen-level

### Requirement 8: Navigation Types and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for all navigation parameters and routes, so that the navigation system is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation types THEN it SHALL define RootStackParamList with Landing, Login, Signup, OfficerRoot, and MemberRoot
2. WHEN creating tab param lists THEN it SHALL define OfficerTabParamList and MemberTabParamList with exact screen names
3. WHEN implementing screen components THEN they SHALL use NativeStackScreenProps for proper typing
4. WHEN navigation parameters are passed THEN they SHALL be properly typed and validated
5. WHEN creating navigation helpers THEN they SHALL use typed navigation props throughout
6. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL be exported from src/types/navigation.ts for reuse across the app

### Requirement 9: Dependency Management and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation system to work with existing dependencies and provide clear guidance for missing packages, so that implementation is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL use only dependencies present in package.json (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/native-stack, @expo/vector-icons, react-native-vector-icons)
2. WHEN @react-navigation/bottom-tabs is missing THEN system SHALL create fallback tab navigation using TouchableOpacity and state management
3. WHEN missing dependencies are detected THEN system SHALL create dependency report documenting required installations
4. WHEN fallback components are created THEN they SHALL maintain same interface as full implementations
5. WHEN navigation fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN implementing fallbacks THEN they SHALL be documented with TODO comments for future enhancement

### Requirement 10: Integration and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing procedures and integration guidelines, so that the navigation system works reliably across all user scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation is complete THEN it SHALL include manual test checklist for verifying all user flows
2. WHEN testing navigation THEN it SHALL verify Landing → role selection → Login → Signup → role-specific navigation flows
3. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL include integration with existing Supabase auth and profile fetching
4. WHEN navigation is deployed THEN it SHALL handle offline scenarios and authentication state persistence
5. WHEN testing role transitions THEN it SHALL verify proper navigation reset and access control enforcement
6. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include troubleshooting guide and common issue resolution
