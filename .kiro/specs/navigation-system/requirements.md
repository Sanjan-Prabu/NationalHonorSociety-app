# Navigation System Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete navigation architecture for the National Honor Society / National Honor Society Associated (NHS/NHSA) React Native app. The navigation system must provide role-based access control, seamless user experience across member and officer views, and maintain consistency with the existing app architecture using React Navigation, NativeWind styling, and the current project dependencies.

The navigation system will replace any existing navigation structure and provide a production-ready, scalable foundation that supports both NHS and NHSA organizations with distinct member and officer experiences while maintaining code reusability and type safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Navigation Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured navigation system that follows React Navigation best practices, so that the app is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation system is implemented THEN it SHALL use only dependencies already present in package.json (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/native-stack, @react-native-vector-icons)
2. WHEN creating navigation components THEN the system SHALL follow the FRC 2658 pattern with createNativeStackNavigator() for feature stacks and createBottomTabNavigator() for main navigation
3. WHEN organizing navigation files THEN all navigators SHALL be placed in src/navigation/ directory with clear naming conventions
4. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions for navigation params and routes
5. WHEN navigation is complete THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README.md explaining the navigation structure and how to extend it

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only the navigation options relevant to my role (member or officer), so that the interface is clean and appropriate for my permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the navigation SHALL display tabs and screens based on their role (member vs officer)
2. WHEN implementing role checks THEN the system SHALL use a centralized Roles enum and roleHierarchy mapping
3. WHEN an officer accesses the app THEN they SHALL see all member features plus additional officer-only features
4. WHEN a member accesses the app THEN they SHALL NOT see any officer-only navigation options or screens
5. WHEN role-based navigation is implemented THEN it SHALL use a RoleBasedHeaderButton component for conditional header actions
6. WHEN roles change THEN the navigation SHALL dynamically update without requiring app restart

### Requirement 3: Member Navigation Experience

**User Story:** As a member, I want intuitive navigation to core features like attendance, volunteer hours, and announcements, so that I can efficiently complete my NHS/NHSA activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. When the user opens the app for the first time they are at the landing screen, but if the user has already been detected as a authenicated users then take to the login screen.
2. WHEN a member logs in to the app THEN they SHALL see a bottom tab navigation with: Home, Attendance, Volunteer, Announcements, Profile
3. WHEN accessing the Home tab THEN members SHALL see dashboard, events, and quick actions with header navigation to related screens
4. WHEN accessing the Attendance tab THEN members SHALL see BLE scanning interface, session joining, and personal attendance history
5. WHEN accessing the Volunteer tab THEN members SHALL see hour submission forms and their volunteer history
6. WHEN accessing the Announcements tab THEN members SHALL see organization announcements and event notifications
7. WHEN accessing the Profile tab THEN members SHALL see personal information, settings, and account management
8. WHEN navigating between screens THEN all transitions SHALL be smooth with consistent header styling (headerTitleAlign: "center")

### Requirement 4: Officer Navigation Experience

**User Story:** As an officer, I want access to management features in addition to member features, so that I can effectively administer NHS/NHSA operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an officer opens the app they SHALL see the login screens
1. WHEN an officer opens ththey SHALL see all officver tabs 
2. WHEN officers access the Attendance tab THEN they SHALL see additional header buttons for "Create Session" and "Manage Attendance"
3. WHEN officers access the Volunteer tab THEN they SHALL see additional header buttons for "Approve Hours" and "Hour Reports"
4. WHEN officers access the Announcements tab THEN they SHALL see additional header buttons for "Create Announcement" and "Manage Posts"
5. WHEN officers access the Officer Dashboard THEN they SHALL see analytics, event creation, user management, and administrative tools
6. WHEN officers navigate THEN all officer-only features SHALL be clearly distinguished but integrated seamlessly with member features
7. WHEN implementing officer features THEN they SHALL inherit all member capabilities automatically

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Onboarding Navigation

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear navigation through authentication and setup processes, so that I can quickly access the app's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL see an AuthNavigator with Login, Register, and Forgot Password screens
2. WHEN implementing auth navigation THEN it SHALL use bottom tabs for Login and Register, with conditional Forgot Password access
3. WHEN a user completes authentication THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected to the appropriate role-based navigation
4. WHEN auth screens are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent theming and icon styling
5. WHEN navigation dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL create fallback components and document required installations
6. WHEN auth navigation is complete THEN it SHALL handle deep linking and password reset tokens appropriately

### Requirement 6: Consistent UI and Theming

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual design across all navigation elements, so that the app feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation THEN all components SHALL use NativeWind for styling consistency
2. WHEN creating header buttons THEN they SHALL use theme-aware colors (light/dark mode support)
3. WHEN displaying tab icons THEN they SHALL use react-native-vector-icons with consistent sizing and colors
4. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL create reusable components (RoleBasedHeaderButton, TabBarIcon) to avoid code duplication
5. WHEN styling navigation THEN it SHALL follow the existing app's design patterns and color schemes
6. WHEN navigation is complete THEN it SHALL be fully accessible with proper screen reader support and touch targets

### Requirement 7: Organization Context (NHS vs NHSA)

**User Story:** As a user who belongs to NHS or NHSA, I want the navigation to reflect my organization context, so that I see relevant content and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user belongs to NHS THEN navigation SHALL show NHS-specific content and branding
2. WHEN a user belongs to NHSA THEN navigation SHALL show NHSA-specific content and branding
3. WHEN implementing org-specific navigation THEN it SHALL maintain the same navigation structure across both organizations
4. WHEN users switch between organizations THEN navigation SHALL update context without structural changes
5. WHEN displaying organization content THEN navigation SHALL filter events, announcements, and features by organization membership
6. WHEN implementing org context THEN it SHALL support users who may have memberships in both NHS and NHSA

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability
