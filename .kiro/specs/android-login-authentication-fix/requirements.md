# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the Android login authentication error where users receive "Invalid session data received from server" when attempting to sign in with valid credentials. The issue stems from a mismatch between the expected session data format in the mobile app and what the signin Edge Function returns based on client detection.

## Glossary

- **Edge_Function**: The Supabase signin function that handles authentication requests
- **Mobile_App**: The React Native Android application
- **Session_Data**: Authentication tokens and user information returned after successful login
- **Token_Strategy**: The method used to deliver authentication tokens (cookie vs response body)
- **Client_Detection**: The process of determining whether a request comes from mobile or web

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to successfully log in on Android devices, so that I can access the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid credentials on Android, THE Mobile_App SHALL receive complete session data including access_token and refresh_token
2. WHEN the signin request is made from Android, THE Edge_Function SHALL detect the client as mobile and return tokens in response body
3. WHEN session data is received, THE Mobile_App SHALL validate that all required token fields are present before proceeding
4. WHEN authentication is successful, THE Mobile_App SHALL store the session data and navigate to the authenticated state
5. WHEN authentication fails due to invalid credentials, THE Mobile_App SHALL display appropriate error messages without exposing system details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable client detection for mobile apps, so that authentication tokens are delivered using the appropriate strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request contains mobile-specific headers or user agents, THE Edge_Function SHALL classify the client as mobile
2. WHEN the clientType parameter is explicitly set to 'mobile', THE Edge_Function SHALL override automatic detection and use mobile token strategy
3. WHEN client detection is uncertain, THE Edge_Function SHALL default to mobile token strategy for maximum compatibility
4. WHEN using mobile token strategy, THE Edge_Function SHALL include access_token and refresh_token in the response body
5. WHEN using web token strategy, THE Edge_Function SHALL set tokens as secure HttpOnly cookies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that authentication issues can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session data validation fails, THE Mobile_App SHALL log detailed error information including expected vs received data structure
2. WHEN client detection occurs, THE Edge_Function SHALL log the detection method and resulting strategy
3. WHEN authentication requests are processed, THE Edge_Function SHALL log request metadata including user agent and client type
4. WHEN errors occur during authentication, THE Mobile_App SHALL provide user-friendly error messages while logging technical details
5. WHEN session storage fails, THE Mobile_App SHALL attempt recovery and log the failure details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want consistent authentication behavior across different Android devices and versions, so that login works reliably regardless of device configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is attempted on any Android device, THE Mobile_App SHALL send consistent request headers and parameters
2. WHEN the Edge_Function processes mobile requests, THE Edge_Function SHALL handle various Android user agent strings correctly
3. WHEN session data is processed, THE Mobile_App SHALL handle both current and legacy session data formats gracefully
4. WHEN network conditions vary, THE Mobile_App SHALL implement appropriate retry logic for authentication requests
5. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Mobile_App SHALL synchronize with the Supabase client session properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want authentication to maintain security standards while fixing the mobile login issue, so that the fix doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are returned in response body for mobile clients, THE Edge_Function SHALL include security guidance headers
2. WHEN session data is transmitted, THE Edge_Function SHALL ensure all security validations and rate limiting remain active
3. WHEN authentication succeeds, THE Mobile_App SHALL store tokens using secure platform-specific storage mechanisms
4. WHEN session validation occurs, THE Mobile_App SHALL verify token integrity and expiration before use
5. WHEN authentication fails, THE Edge_Function SHALL maintain existing security logging and monitoring without exposing sensitive information
