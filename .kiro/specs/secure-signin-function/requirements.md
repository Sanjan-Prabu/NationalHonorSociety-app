# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure Sign-in Supabase Edge Function that provides server-side authentication for the mobile app. The function will handle email/password authentication with comprehensive security controls, proper token management, and consistent error handling while leveraging Supabase's built-in authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to securely sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my authenticated account with proper session management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate against Supabase Auth and return a success response with session tokens
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a generic error message without revealing specific failure reasons
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL set secure HttpOnly cookies OR return tokens with clear security guidance
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL return minimal user information (id, email, role) in the response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the sign-in function to implement comprehensive security controls, so that the system is protected against common authentication attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function receives requests THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. WHEN invalid input is received THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring and audit purposes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return minimal information to prevent information disclosure
5. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL use HttpOnly, Secure, and appropriate SameSite attributes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the function to use Supabase's standard authentication flow with proper key management, so that tokens are handled securely and admin privileges are not misused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing user authentication THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's standard auth flow with anon key (not service_role)
2. WHEN admin operations are required THEN the system SHALL use service_role key only for legitimate admin actions
3. WHEN handling JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL ensure tokens are validated against the project's signing keys
4. WHEN Row-Level Security policies exist THEN the system SHALL enforce RLS to prevent token misuse

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want clear deployment and verification procedures, so that I can confidently deploy and validate the function in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the function THEN there SHALL be a clear deployment checklist with verification steps
2. WHEN the function is deployed THEN there SHALL be test procedures to verify success and failure scenarios
3. WHEN JWT keys need rotation THEN there SHALL be documented procedures for handling key rotation
4. WHEN monitoring the function THEN there SHALL be clear logging and observability guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile app, I want consistent JSON responses and proper CORS handling, so that I can reliably integrate with the authentication function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to the function THEN the system SHALL handle CORS properly with restricted origins
2. WHEN receiving responses THEN all responses SHALL follow a consistent JSON structure
3. WHEN errors occur THEN error responses SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback without security information disclosure
