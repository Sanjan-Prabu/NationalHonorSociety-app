# Volunteer Hours Verification System Requirements

## Introduction

A comprehensive volunteer hours verification system that allows members to submit volunteer hour requests with proof documentation, and enables officers to review, approve, or reject these requests. The system tracks both general volunteer hours and organization-led event hours, with different validation workflows and status tracking.

## Glossary

- **Member**: A user with member role who can submit volunteer hour requests
- **Officer**: A user with officer role who can approve/reject volunteer hour requests
- **Volunteer_Hours_System**: The complete system managing volunteer hour submissions and approvals
- **Organization_Event**: An event created by officers that can be selected during volunteer hour submission
- **Verification_Request**: A submitted volunteer hour entry awaiting officer approval
- **Proof_Documentation**: Image or signature evidence of volunteer work completion

## Requirements

5. WHEN a rejection is submitted with reason, THE Volunteer_Hours_System SHALL update request status and store rejection reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a member, I want to see the status of my volunteer hour requests, so that I can track approval progress and respond to rejections.

1. THE Volunteer_Hours_System SHALL display verified requests with green "Verified" tag under "Recently Approved" section
2. THE Volunteer_Hours_System SHALL display rejected requests with red "Rejected" tag and officer's rejection reason

4. THE Volunteer_Hours_System SHALL dynamically update progress bar with verified totals and organization-specific hours when requests are verified
5. THE Volunteer_Hours_System SHALL display organization event hours as separate metric (e.g., "NHS Events: 5")

### Requirement 5
