# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of a complete event management system that mirrors the announcements functionality. Officers can create events with categories, and these events are displayed in card format to both officers and members. Events are stored in the database for integration with the volunteer hours system, allowing members to select organization events when logging volunteer hours.

## Glossary

- **Officer_User**: A user with role='officer' who can create and delete events
- **Member_User**: A user with role='member' who can view events and select them for volunteer hours
- **Event_System**: The subsystem handling officer-created events with categories, dates, and descriptions
- **Event_Card**: UI component displaying event information in card format similar to announcements
- **Event_Categories**: Predefined categories (fundraiser, volunteering, education, custom) with color-coded tags
- **Volunteer_Hours_Integration**: System allowing members to select organization events when logging volunteer hours
- **Organization_Context**: The active organization determining event visibility scope
