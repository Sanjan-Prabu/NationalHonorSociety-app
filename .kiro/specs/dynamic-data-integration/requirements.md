# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing dynamic data integration across all screens in the NHS/NHSA mobile application. The system must replace all static, mock, or placeholder data with live data fetched from Supabase, ensuring real-time data synchronization and proper role-based access control.

## Glossary

- **NHS_App**: The National Honor Society mobile application built with React Native and Expo
- **Supabase_Backend**: The backend service providing authentication, database, and real-time capabilities
- **Dynamic_Data**: Live data fetched from the database rather than hardcoded values
- **RLS**: Row Level Security policies that enforce data isolation by organization
- **Profile_System**: User profile management system that handles role-based access
- **Organization_Context**: The current organization scope for data filtering
- **Real_Time_Sync**: Live data updates that reflect immediately in the application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a member or officer, I want my profile data to load instantly and accurately after login, so that I can see my correct role, organization, and personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes authentication, THE Profile_System SHALL fetch user data from the profiles table using the authenticated user ID
2. THE Profile_System SHALL display the user's name, role, and organization information within 2 seconds of login
3. IF profile data is missing or corrupted, THEN THE Profile_System SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent navigation
4. THE Profile_System SHALL validate that the user's role matches their assigned permissions before allowing screen access
5. WHERE the user belongs to multiple organizations, THE Profile_System SHALL load the primary organization context by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a member, I want to see my actual volunteer hours, attendance records, and events from the database, so that I can track my real progress and participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member accesses the volunteer hours screen, THE NHS_App SHALL fetch volunteer_hours records filtered by user ID and organization ID
2. WHEN a member views attendance records, THE NHS_App SHALL display attendance data from the attendance table with proper date formatting
3. WHEN a member browses events, THE NHS_App SHALL load events from the events table filtered by the user's organization
4. THE NHS_App SHALL display loading states during data fetching operations
5. IF no data exists for a screen, THEN THE NHS_App SHALL show an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an officer, I want to access real-time dashboards and management screens with live organizational data, so that I can effectively manage members and events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an officer accesses the dashboard, THE NHS_App SHALL fetch aggregated statistics from multiple tables filtered by organization ID
2. WHEN an officer views volunteer approval screens, THE NHS_App SHALL display pending volunteer_hours records requiring approval
3. WHEN an officer manages events, THE NHS_App SHALL load and allow modification of events data from the events table
4. THE NHS_App SHALL enforce officer-only access to administrative screens through role validation
5. WHERE data updates occur, THE NHS_App SHALL reflect changes immediately without requiring screen refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As any user, I want the application to handle data loading gracefully with proper error handling, so that I never encounter crashes or undefined data states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NHS_App SHALL implement loading states for all data fetching operations
2. THE NHS_App SHALL handle network errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
3. IF a database query fails, THEN THE NHS_App SHALL display a retry option and log the error
4. THE NHS_App SHALL prevent rendering of undefined or null data values
5. WHILE data is loading, THE NHS_App SHALL display appropriate loading indicators or skeleton screens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be properly isolated by organization and role, so that I only see information relevant to my access level and organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NHS_App SHALL filter all database queries by the user's organization ID using RLS policies
2. THE NHS_App SHALL enforce role-based data access where members cannot see officer-only information
3. WHEN switching between screens, THE NHS_App SHALL maintain consistent organization context filtering
4. THE NHS_App SHALL validate user permissions before displaying sensitive data
5. IF a user attempts to access unauthorized data, THEN THE NHS_App SHALL redirect to an appropriate screen

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all static and mock data removed from the codebase, so that the application relies entirely on live database content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NHS_App SHALL remove all hardcoded data arrays and mock values from screen components
2. THE NHS_App SHALL replace static imports of mock data with dynamic Supabase queries
3. THE NHS_App SHALL eliminate placeholder text and dummy content from all screens
4. THE NHS_App SHALL implement proper TypeScript interfaces that match the Supabase schema
5. WHERE configuration data is needed, THE NHS_App SHALL store it in the database rather than code files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want data changes to appear instantly across the application, so that I always see the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is modified in one screen, THE NHS_App SHALL update related screens automatically
2. THE NHS_App SHALL implement real-time subscriptions for frequently changing data
3. WHEN new records are created, THE NHS_App SHALL add them to relevant lists without requiring manual refresh
4. THE NHS_App SHALL handle concurrent data modifications gracefully
5. WHERE data conflicts occur, THE NHS_App SHALL prioritize server data over local cache
