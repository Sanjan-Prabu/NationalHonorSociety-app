# UUID Schema Standardization Migration Summary

## Task 2: Implement UUID schema standardization

This migration implements comprehensive UUID schema standardization across the multi-organization database structure.

### Completed Subtasks

#### 2.1 Convert organizations.id to UUID type with safe type conversion
- ✅ Created conditional logic to handle both new table creation and existing table conversion
- ✅ Implemented safe UUID type conversion with validation of existing data
- ✅ Added `gen_random_uuid()` default for new organization records
- ✅ Validated existing organization IDs are valid UUID format before conversion
- ✅ Added proper primary key and unique constraints

**Key Features:**
- Handles both scenarios: creating new organizations table or converting existing one
- Validates all existing IDs are valid UUID format before conversion
- Preserves existing data while upgrading schema
- Adds proper constraints and triggers

#### 2.2 Standardize org_id columns across all organizational tables
- ✅ Created reusable function for safe org_id column type conversion
- ✅ Converted text-based org_id columns to UUID type with error handling
- ✅ Validated referential integrity before type conversion
- ✅ Applied conversion to: profiles, verification_codes, events, files, memberships, volunteer_hours

**Key Features:**
- Reusable conversion function with comprehensive error handling
- Validates existing data format before conversion
- Preserves NULL values appropriately
- Comprehensive logging and validation

#### 2.3 Add missing org_id columns to organizational tables
- ✅ Added org_id UUID columns to attendance, ble_badges, contacts tables
- ✅ Created strategy for handling existing records (nullable initially)
- ✅ Provided data population helper function for future use
- ✅ Ensured all organizational tables have proper org_id columns

**Key Features:**
- Smart handling of existing vs new tables
- Nullable org_id for tables with existing data
- Helper function for populating org_id from default organization
- Comprehensive validation of all organizational tables

### Migration Safety Features

1. **Transaction Safety**: All operations wrapped in proper exception handling
2. **Data Validation**: Pre-conversion validation of UUID format
3. **Rollback Capability**: Proper error handling with descriptive messages
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed NOTICE messages for tracking progress
5. **Validation Steps**: Post-conversion validation to ensure success

### Tables Affected

- `organizations` - Primary table with UUID id
- `profiles` - org_id standardized to UUID
- `verification_codes` - org_id standardized to UUID  
- `events` - org_id ensured as UUID
- `files` - org_id ensured as UUID
- `memberships` - org_id ensured as UUID
- `volunteer_hours` - org_id ensured as UUID
- `attendance` - org_id column added as UUID
- `ble_badges` - org_id column added as UUID
- `contacts` - org_id column added as UUID

### Next Steps

This migration prepares the database for:
- Task 3: Foreign key constraints and referential integrity
- Task 4: RLS helper functions
- Task 5: Row-Level Security implementation

### Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 1.1**: UUID-based organization references ✅
- **Requirement 1.2**: Safe type conversion handling ✅  
- **Requirement 1.3**: Proper foreign key preparation ✅
- **Requirement 2.1**: Comprehensive org_id coverage ✅
- **Requirement 2.2**: NOT NULL constraints (prepared) ✅
- **Requirement 2.3**: Data population strategy ✅

### Usage

Run this migration using Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db reset
# or
supabase migration up
```

The migration is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely.
