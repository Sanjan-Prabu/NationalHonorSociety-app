# Foreign Key Constraints Implementation Summary

## Task 3.1: Create foreign key constraints for all org_id references

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details:
- Created `add_org_id_foreign_key()` helper function with proper error handling
- Fixed ambiguous column reference issues in information_schema queries
- Implemented foreign key constraints for all organizational tables:
  - `profiles.org_id` → `organizations.id` (SET NULL on delete)
  - `events.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `files.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `memberships.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `volunteer_hours.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `verification_codes.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `attendance.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `ble_badges.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)
  - `contacts.org_id` → `organizations.id` (CASCADE on delete)

### Key Features:
- Safe constraint addition with existence checks
- Orphaned record cleanup before constraint creation
- Appropriate CASCADE vs SET NULL behaviors based on data relationships
- Comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Task 3.2: Create composite unique constraints for membership management

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details:
- Created `add_membership_unique_constraint()` helper function
- Added unique constraint on `memberships(user_id, org_id)` to prevent duplicate memberships
- Implemented duplicate data cleanup strategy (keeps most recent membership)
- Created performance indexes for membership lookup patterns:
  - `idx_memberships_user_org` for user-centric queries
  - `idx_memberships_org_role_active` for organization-centric queries
  - `idx_memberships_active_user` partial index for active memberships

### Key Features:
- Duplicate membership detection and cleanup
- Performance optimization through strategic indexing
- Comprehensive validation of constraints and indexes
- Safe constraint addition with rollback capability

## Requirements Satisfied:
- **1.4**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- **2.3**: Proper CASCADE behaviors for organizational data
- **3.1**: Unique membership constraints prevent duplicates
- **3.2**: Membership management with proper constraints
- **3.4**: Performance indexes for efficient queries
- **9.4**: Data integrity validation and error handling

## Migration Status:
The migration file `02_foreign_key_constraints.sql` has been corrected and is ready for execution. All syntax issues have been resolved, including:
- Fixed ambiguous column references in information_schema queries
- Corrected regex pattern for constraint name parsing
- Proper table name qualification throughout the migration

## Next Steps:
Once the database is available, run the migration to apply all foreign key constraints and unique constraints. The migration includes comprehensive validation to ensure all constraints are properly created.
