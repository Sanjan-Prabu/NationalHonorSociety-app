# Event Tag Colors Fix

## Problem
The event category tags were not showing unique colors for each category. All categories were showing as blue in the CreateEventScreen, and the color scheme wasn't consistent.

## Solution
Updated both CreateEventScreen and EventCard to use unique colors for each event category.

## New Color Scheme

### Category Colors
- **Fundraiser** â†’ **Green** (`variant: 'green'`)
- **Volunteering** â†’ **Teal** (`variant: 'teal'`)  
- **Education** â†’ **Purple** (`variant: 'purple'`)
- **Custom** â†’ **Orange** (`variant: 'orange'`)

### Visual Examples
- ðŸŸ¢ **Fundraiser** - Green background with green text
- ðŸ”µ **Volunteering** - Teal background with teal text
- ðŸŸ£ **Education** - Purple background with purple text  
- ðŸŸ  **Custom** - Orange background with orange text

## Changes Made

### 1. CreateEventScreen.tsx
- **Added Tag component import**
- **Updated category selection** to use Tag components instead of plain buttons
- **Updated categoryOptions** with correct color variants
- **Updated styles** to use `categoryTagButton` instead of old button styles

### 2. EventCard.tsx  
- **Updated categoryVariants mapping** to match new color scheme
- **Maintained custom category handling** (defaults to orange for any category not in the predefined list)

### 3. Tag Component
- **Verified all color variants exist** (green, teal, purple, orange)
- **No changes needed** - component already supports all required colors

## User Experience

### In CreateEventScreen
When officers select a category, they now see:
- Each category button shows as a colored tag
- Selected category is highlighted with the appropriate color
- Visual feedback matches the final event display

### In EventCard Display
Events now display with:
- Unique color for each category type
- Consistent colors between creation and display
- Custom categories automatically get orange color

### In Volunteer Hours Form
Events will appear with their category colors when members select organization events.

## Test Events Created
Created test events with different categories to verify colors:
- **Annual Gala Fundraiser** (fundraiser â†’ green)
- **Beach Cleanup Volunteer Event** (volunteering â†’ teal)
- **Leadership Workshop** (education â†’ purple)
- **Test Event** (custom category â†’ orange)

## Verification
The color scheme now works exactly as requested:
âœ… Each category has a unique color
âœ… Custom categories show as orange
âœ… CreateEventScreen shows correct colors when selecting
âœ… EventCard displays match the selection colors
âœ… All colors are visually distinct and accessible
