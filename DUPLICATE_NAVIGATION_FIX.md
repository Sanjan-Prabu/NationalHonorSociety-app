# Duplicate Navigation Fix Summary

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The issue was that individual screens were importing and rendering their own navigation components, causing double navigation bars to appear.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Member Screens Cleaned Up:**
- ✅ `src/screens/member/nhs/AnnouncementsScreen.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/member/nhs/AttendanceScreen.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/member/nhs/EventScreen.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/member/nhs/LogHoursScreen.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/member/nhs/DashboardScreen.tsx` (already fixed)

### **Officer Screens Already Clean:**
- ✅ `src/screens/officer/nhs/OfficerDashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/officer/nhs/OfficerAnnouncements.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/officer/nhs/OfficerAttendance.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/officer/nhs/OfficerVerifyHours.tsx`
- ✅ `src/screens/officer/nhs/OfficerEventScreen.tsx`

## 🗑️ **Removed From Each Screen:**

1. **Duplicate Import:**
   ```tsx
   import BottomNavigator, { useBottomNav } from 'components/ui/BottomNavigator';
   ```

2. **Unused Hook:**
   ```tsx
   const { setActiveTab } = useBottomNav();
   ```

3. **Unnecessary useEffect:**
   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     setActiveTab('screen-name');
   }, [setActiveTab]);
   ```

4. **Unused Function:**
   ```tsx
   const handleTabPress = (tabName: string) => {
     if (tabName !== 'current-screen') {
       navigation.navigate(tabName);
     }
   };
   ```

5. **Duplicate Navigation Component:**
   ```tsx
   <BottomNavigator onTabPress={handleTabPress} />
   ```

## ✅ **Result:**

- **Single Navigation**: Only the main navigator (MemberBottomNavigator/OfficerBottomNavigator) handles navigation
- **No Duplicates**: Individual screens no longer render their own navigation
- **Clean Code**: Removed all unused imports, hooks, and functions
- **Proper Architecture**: Navigation is centralized and managed properly

## 🎯 **How Navigation Now Works:**

1. **Main App Level**: RootNavigator determines user role
2. **Role-Based Navigation**: Shows MemberRoot or OfficerRoot
3. **Tab Navigation**: MemberBottomNavigator or OfficerBottomNavigator handles tabs
4. **Screen Content**: Individual screens only handle their content, not navigation

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Dashboard: Single navigation bar at bottom
- ✅ Announcements: Single navigation bar at bottom
- ✅ Attendance: Single navigation bar at bottom
- ✅ Events: Single navigation bar at bottom
- ✅ Log Hours: Single navigation bar at bottom
- ✅ All Officer Screens: Single navigation bar at bottom

**No more double navigation bars anywhere in the app!**
