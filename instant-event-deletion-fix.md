# Instant Event Deletion Fix

## Problem
Event deletion required a page reload or tab switch to see the deletion, unlike announcements which updated instantly.

## Root Cause
The event deletion system was waiting for realtime subscriptions to update the UI, while announcements used **optimistic updates** for instant feedback.

## Solution Applied
Made event deletion work exactly like announcement deletion by implementing **optimistic updates**.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `useEventData` Hook - Optimistic Updates
**Before**: Only did optimistic updates if realtime was disabled
```typescript
// Only updated UI if realtime was disabled
if (!enableRealtime) {
  setEvents(prev => prev.filter(event => event.id !== id));
}
```

**After**: Always does optimistic updates like announcements
```typescript
// Optimistically remove from UI immediately for better UX (like announcements)
const originalEvents = events;
setEvents(prev => prev.filter(event => event.id !== id));

// Revert if API call fails
if (!result.success) {
  setEvents(originalEvents);
}
```

### 2. Updated `useOfficerEvents` Hook - Return Full API Response
**Before**: Only returned boolean success status
```typescript
const deleteEventWrapper = async (eventId: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  const result = await eventData.deleteEvent(eventId);
  return result.success;
};
```

**After**: Returns full API response for better error handling
```typescript
const deleteEventWrapper = async (eventId: string): Promise<ApiResponse<boolean>> => {
  const result = await eventData.deleteEvent(eventId);
  return result;
};
```

### 3. Updated `OfficerEventsScreen` - Better User Feedback
**Before**: Used basic Alert.alert for all messages
```typescript
if (!success) {
  Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to delete event');
}
```

**After**: Uses toast notifications like announcements
```typescript
if (result.success) {
  showSuccess('Deleted', 'Event removed successfully.');
} else {
  showError('Delete Failed', result.error || 'Failed to delete event.');
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Optimistic Update Flow:
1. **User clicks delete** → Confirmation dialog appears
2. **User confirms** → Event **immediately disappears** from UI
3. **API call executes** in background
4. **If API succeeds** → UI stays updated (success toast)
5. **If API fails** → Event reappears in UI (error toast)

### Same as Announcements:
- ✅ **Instant visual feedback** - no waiting for API
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** - reverts UI if deletion fails  
- ✅ **Toast notifications** - consistent user experience
- ✅ **Optimistic updates** - UI updates before API completes

## Expected Result
Event deletion now works exactly like announcement deletion:
- ✅ **Instant UI updates** - events disappear immediately when deleted
- ✅ **No reload required** - UI updates optimistically
- ✅ **Consistent experience** - matches announcements behavior
- ✅ **Better error handling** - shows specific error messages
- ✅ **Toast notifications** - professional user feedback

The event system now provides the same smooth, instant user experience as the announcements system.
