# âœ… Removed Rejected Tab from Officer View

## ðŸŽ¯ Reasoning
Since rejected requests go back to members for editing and resubmission, officers don't need to see them. This simplifies the workflow and removes unnecessary complexity.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### **Officer View Simplified**
- **Before**: 3 tabs - "Pending", "Approved", "Rejected"
- **After**: 2 tabs - "Pending", "Approved" âœ…

### **Workflow Now**:
1. **Member submits** â†’ Appears in officer "Pending" tab
2. **Officer approves** â†’ Moves to officer "Approved" tab
3. **Officer rejects** â†’ Goes back to member for editing (not visible to officer)
4. **Member edits & resubmits** â†’ Appears in officer "Pending" tab again

### **Code Changes**:
- âœ… Removed `'rejected'` from `TabType`
- âœ… Removed `useRejectedApprovals` import
- âœ… Removed rejected tab UI elements
- âœ… Simplified tab logic and counts
- âœ… Updated empty states

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- **Cleaner officer interface** - only see what matters âœ…
- **Simplified workflow** - pending â†’ approved âœ…
- **Better performance** - fewer queries âœ…
- **Less confusion** - officers focus on actionable items âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ Officer View Now

### **Pending Tab**
- Shows all requests awaiting approval
- Officers can approve or reject
- Rejected requests disappear (go to member)

### **Approved Tab**

## âœ… Result

Officer view is now **clean and focused**:

- No clutter from rejected requests
- Streamlined approval workflow

**Status**: âœ… **SIMPLIFIED** - Officer view now has clean 2-tab interface!
