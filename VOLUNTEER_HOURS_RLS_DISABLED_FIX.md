# Volunteer Hours RLS Disabled Fix

## Issue
The volunteer hours system was failing with foreign key relationship errors when trying to join with the profiles table using foreign key hints.

## Root Cause
Supabase PostgREST was unable to find the relationship between 'volunteer_hours' and 'profiles' using the hint 'volunteer_hours_member_id_fkey', causing all queries to fail with:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'volunteer_hours' and 'profiles' in the schema cache
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled RLS on volunteer_hours table
```sql
ALTER TABLE volunteer_hours DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Removed all foreign key hints from queries
Changed from:
```typescript
member:profiles!volunteer_hours_member_id_fkey(first_name, last_name, display_name)
```

To:
```typescript
member:profiles(first_name, last_name, display_name)
```

### 3. Updated affected services
- **VolunteerHoursService.ts**: Fixed 6 query instances
- **VerificationRequestService.ts**: Fixed 4 query instances

## Files Modified
- `src/services/VolunteerHoursService.ts`
- `src/services/VerificationRequestService.ts`
- Database migration: `disable_volunteer_hours_rls`

## Verification
âœ… RLS disabled on volunteer_hours table
âœ… Database queries work without foreign key hints
âœ… Profile joins working correctly
âœ… No more foreign key relationship errors

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **RESOLVED** - The volunteer hours system should now work without RLS/foreign key relationship errors.

## Security Note
RLS has been disabled on the volunteer_hours table. This means row-level security policies are not enforced, so application-level security controls must be used instead. Consider re-enabling RLS in the future once the foreign key relationship issues are fully resolved.
