# 🚨 FIXED: Foreign Key Relationship Error

## ❌ Problem
I accidentally changed the foreign key reference from:
```sql
approver:profiles!volunteer_hours_verified_by_fkey
```
to:
```sql
approver:profiles!volunteer_hours_approved_by_fkey  -- ❌ WRONG!
```

This caused the error:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'volunteer_hours' and 'profiles' 
using the hint 'volunteer_hours_approved_by_fkey'
```

## ✅ Solution - FIXED!

Reverted the foreign key reference back to the correct one:
```sql
approver:profiles!volunteer_hours_verified_by_fkey  -- ✅ CORRECT!
```

## 🔧 What I Fixed

1. **Restored correct foreign key name** ✅
2. **Reverted ordering back to activity_date** ✅  
3. **Kept the simplified query conditions** ✅

## ✅ Result

- **Foreign key error resolved** ✅
- **Database relationships working** ✅
- **Queries should load fast** ✅
- **All volunteer hours data accessible** ✅

**Status**: 🚨 **EMERGENCY FIX COMPLETE** - Database relationships restored!
