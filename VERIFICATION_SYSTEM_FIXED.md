# Verification System - FIXED

## Overview
The verification code system has been completely fixed and simplified. There are now exactly 2 universal verification codes that work for both NHS and NHSA organizations.

## Verification Codes

### Member Code: `50082571`
- **Purpose**: For creating member accounts
- **Valid for**: NHS and NHSA members
- **Role restrictions**: Only works with `role: "member"`
- **Reusable**: Yes (universal code, not marked as used)

### Officer Code: `97655500`
- **Purpose**: For creating officer accounts
- **Valid for**: NHS and NHSA officers, presidents, vice_presidents, admins
- **Role restrictions**: Only works with officer-level roles
- **Reusable**: Yes (universal code, not marked as used)

## How It Works

### Database Setup
```sql
-- Current verification codes in database
SELECT * FROM verification_codes;

-- Results:
-- code: '50082571', code_type: 'member', org: 'UNIVERSAL', is_used: false
-- code: '97655500', code_type: 'officer', org: 'UNIVERSAL', is_used: false
```

### Signup Logic
1. User provides verification code during signup
2. System validates code exists and is not expired
3. System checks role compatibility:
   - `50082571` → Only allows `member` role
   - `97655500` → Allows `officer`, `president`, `vice_president`, `admin` roles
4. Code is NOT marked as used (universal codes are reusable)
5. Account is created successfully

### Organization Support
- Both codes work for **NHS** and **NHSA** organizations
- No organization-specific restrictions
- Single code entry supports both orgs

## Testing
Use the provided `test-verification-system.sh` script to test all scenarios:
- Member signup with member code ✅
- Officer signup with officer code ✅
- Cross-organization usage ✅
- Invalid code rejection ✅
- Wrong role/code combination rejection ✅

## API Usage

### Member Signup (NHS or NHSA)
```json
{
  "email": "member@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "organization": "NHS", // or "NHSA"
  "role": "member",
  "code": "50082571"
}
```

### Officer Signup (NHS or NHSA)
```json
{
  "email": "officer@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "organization": "NHS", // or "NHSA"
  "role": "officer",
  "code": "97655500"
}
```

## Error Handling
- Invalid code: "Invalid or expired verification code"
- Wrong role for member code: "This verification code is only valid for member accounts"
- Wrong role for officer code: "This verification code is only valid for officer accounts"
- Missing code: "Missing required fields. Verification code is required for signup."

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The verification system is now working correctly with the exact codes you specified. You can create accounts using:
- **50082571** for members (NHS/NHSA)
- **97655500** for officers (NHS/NHSA)
