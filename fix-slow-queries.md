# âš¡ Fixed Slow Volunteer Hours Queries

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Complex `.or()` queries were causing timeouts and slow loading in the officer view.

## ðŸ”§ Solution - Simplified Queries

### **Before (Slow & Complex)**:
```sql
.or('status.eq.rejected,and(approved.eq.false,rejection_reason.not.is.null)')
```

### **After (Fast & Simple)**:
```sql
.eq('approved', false)
.not('rejection_reason', 'is', null)
```

## âš¡ Query Optimizations

### **Rejected Hours** (Fast):
```sql
SELECT * FROM volunteer_hours 
WHERE org_id = ? 
AND approved = false 
AND rejection_reason IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
```

### **Verified Hours** (Fast):
```sql
SELECT * FROM volunteer_hours 
WHERE org_id = ? 
AND approved = true
ORDER BY approved_at DESC
```

### **Pending Hours** (Fast):
```sql
SELECT * FROM volunteer_hours 
WHERE org_id = ? 
AND approved = false 
AND rejection_reason IS NULL
ORDER BY submitted_at ASC
```
