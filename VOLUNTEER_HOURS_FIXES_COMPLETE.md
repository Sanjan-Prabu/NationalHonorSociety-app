## üîÑ Real-time Synchronization

### Database Triggers
- **Instant Notifications**: `pg_notify` triggers on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- **Cross-session Updates**: Changes visible immediately across all user sessions
- **Organization Scoped**: Notifications include org_id for proper filtering

### Frontend Integration
- **Automatic Refetch**: React Query automatically refetches on database changes
- **Tab Updates**: Status changes immediately move cards to appropriate tabs
- **Live Counts**: Tab badges update in real-time

## üéØ Status Workflow

### Member Workflow
1. **Submit Request**: Status = `pending`, appears in "Pending Entries" tab
2. **Delete Pending**: Can delete requests with `pending` or `rejected` status
3. **Edit Rejected**: Pencil icon allows editing and resubmission
4. **View Approved**: Verified requests appear in "Recently Approved" (read-only)

### Officer Workflow
1. **Review Pending**: All `pending` requests appear in "Pending Entries" tab
2. **Approve Request**: 
   - Status changes to `verified`
   - Sets `verified_by` and `verified_at`
   - Moves to "Recently Approved" tab
3. **Reject Request**:
   - Status changes to `rejected`
   - Requires `rejection_reason`
   - Moves to "Rejected" tab
   - Member can see reason and edit request

### Resubmission Cycle
1. **Member Edits**: Rejected request can be edited via pencil icon
2. **Status Reset**: Upon resubmission, status returns to `pending`
3. **Reason Cleared**: Previous rejection reason is cleared
4. **Infinite Loop**: Process can repeat indefinitely until approved

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Validation

### Database Constraints
- **Status Values**: Enum constraint ensures only valid status values
- **Rejection Reason**: Required when status is `rejected`
- **Verification Fields**: Required when status is `verified`
- **Hours Limit**: Maximum 24 hours per entry
- **Positive Hours**: Must be greater than 0

### Frontend Validation
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation on field changes

## üé® Color Consistency

### Theme Colors
- **Royal Blue**: Consistent use of `#2B5CE6` throughout
- **Status Colors**:
  - Pending: Yellow (`#ECC94B`)
  - Verified: Green (`#48BB78`)
  - Rejected: Red (`#E53E3E`)

### Tag Component
