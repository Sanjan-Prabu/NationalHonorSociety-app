# Import Path Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Incorrect Import Paths**
**Problem**: The import paths for ProfileButton were incorrect in both dashboard files.

**Fixed**:
- **Member Dashboard**: Changed from `../../components/ui/ProfileButton` to `../../../components/ui/ProfileButton`
- **Officer Dashboard**: Changed from `../../components/ui/ProfileButton` to `../../../components/ui/ProfileButton`

### **2. TypeScript Navigation Error**
**Problem**: TypeScript error with navigation.reset() due to strict typing.

**Fixed**: Added type assertion `(navigation as any).reset()` to handle the navigation reset properly.

## ✅ **File Structure Clarification:**

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── ProfileButton.tsx          ← Target file
│       └── ProfileMenuModal.tsx
├── screens/
│   ├── member/
│   │   └── nhs/
│   │       └── DashboardScreen.tsx    ← Needs ../../../ to reach components/
│   └── officer/
│       └── nhs/
│           └── OfficerDashboard.tsx   ← Needs ../../../ to reach components/
```

## ✅ **Import Path Logic:**
- From `src/screens/member/nhs/` to `src/components/ui/`: Need to go up 3 levels (`../../../`)
- From `src/screens/officer/nhs/` to `src/components/ui/`: Need to go up 3 levels (`../../../`)

## ✅ **All Diagnostics Clear:**
- ✅ ProfileButton.tsx: No errors
- ✅ ProfileMenuModal.tsx: No errors  
- ✅ Member DashboardScreen.tsx: No errors
- ✅ Officer DashboardScreen.tsx: No errors

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**
The logout feature should now work properly. Try:
1. Restart your development server
2. Navigate to either dashboard
3. Tap the profile icon in the top-right corner
4. Test the logout functionality
