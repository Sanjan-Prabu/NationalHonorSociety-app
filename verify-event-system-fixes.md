# Event System Fixes Verification

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Navigation Animation
- **Issue**: CreateEvent screen was opening as a modal
- **Fix**: Changed `presentation: 'modal'` to `animation: 'slide_from_right'` in `src/navigation/OfficerStack.tsx`
- **Result**: Now the CreateEvent screen slides in from the right and back button navigates back properly

### 2. Fixed Realtime Subscriptions
- **Issue**: `useEventSubscriptions` hook was using `currentOrganization` instead of `activeOrganization`
- **Fix**: Updated `src/hooks/useEventSubscriptions.ts` to use the correct property name
- **Result**: Realtime updates now work properly when events are created/deleted

### 3. Removed Duplicate Subscriptions
- **Issue**: `OfficerEventsScreen` was using both `useOfficerEvents` and `useEventSubscriptions` causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed the separate `useEventSubscriptions` call since `useOfficerEvents` already includes realtime functionality
- **Result**: Cleaner code and no subscription conflicts

### 4. Verified Event Creation Functionality
- **Status**: Event creation through `CreateEventScreen` works properly
- **Database**: Events table has all necessary columns (title, description, location, event_date, starts_at, ends_at, category, etc.)
- **Service**: `EventService.createEvent()` handles validation and database insertion correctly

### 5. Verified Event Display
- **EventCard Component**: Properly displays events with category tags, dates, times, and locations
- **Tag Component**: Has all necessary variants including orange for custom categories
- **Categories**: Supports fundraiser (orange), volunteering (teal), education (purple), and custom (orange)

### 6. Verified Volunteer Hours Integration
- **Integration**: `MemberVolunteerHoursForm` uses `useOrganizationEvents()` to fetch events
- **Display**: Events populate in the volunteer hours form when "Organization Event" is selected
- **Storage**: Event ID is stored with volunteer hours submissions for tracking

## Test Events Created

I created test events in the database to verify functionality:

   - Location: Santa Monica Beach

3. **Leadership Workshop** (ID: bf0fdfe9-fb99-41c1-b373-5afc7972ffb9)
   - Category: Leadership Development (custom)
