# RLS Policy Fix for Event Deletion

## Problem
Users were getting a Row Level Security (RLS) policy violation error when trying to delete events:
```
ERROR: new row violates row-level security policy for table "events"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was with the RLS policies on the `events` table. The UPDATE policy was either:
1. Too restrictive and not allowing legitimate soft deletion operations
2. Had conflicting `with_check` conditions
3. Not properly handling the authentication context

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed RLS UPDATE Policy
- **Removed conflicting policies**: Dropped multiple UPDATE policies that were causing conflicts
- **Created comprehensive policy**: Single clear policy that allows updates for:
  - Event creators (`created_by = auth.uid()`)
  - Officers in the organization (`is_officer_of(org_id)`)
- **No with_check restrictions**: Removed complex `with_check` conditions that were blocking legitimate operations

### 2. Enhanced Logging in EventService
- **Added detailed logging** to `softDeleteEvent()` method to track:
  - User authentication status
  - Permission checks (creator vs officer)
  - Database operation attempts
- **Enhanced `hasOfficerPermissions()`** with logging to debug membership issues

### 3. Verified Membership Records
- **Confirmed user has officer membership** in the organization
- **Verified RLS functions work** (`is_officer_of`, `is_member_of`)

## Current RLS Policies for Events Table

```sql
-- SELECT: Only active events for organization members
events_select_policy: (status = 'active' AND is_member_of(org_id))

-- INSERT: Only officers can create events
events_insert_policy: (is_officer_of(org_id) AND created_by = auth.uid())

-- UPDATE: Event creators and officers can update
events_comprehensive_update_policy: (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND (created_by = auth.uid() OR is_officer_of(org_id)))

-- DELETE: Disabled (we use soft deletion)
events_delete_policy: false
```

## How Soft Deletion Now Works

1. **User clicks delete button** on an event
2. **Authentication check**: `getCurrentUserId()` verifies user is logged in
3. **Permission check**: Verifies user is either:
   - Creator of the event, OR
   - Officer in the organization
4. **RLS policy check**: Database verifies same permissions via RLS
5. **Soft delete operation**: Updates event with:
   ```sql
   UPDATE events SET 
     status = 'deleted',
     deleted_by = auth.uid(),
     deleted_at = NOW(),
     updated_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = event_id
   ```
6. **UI update**: Realtime subscription removes event from display

## Testing
The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues:
- Check console logs for permission check details
- Verify user authentication status
- Confirm membership records are correct

## Expected Result
Event deletion should now work properly for:
- ✅ Officers in the organization
- ✅ Creators of their own events
- ✅ Proper audit trail maintained
- ✅ Realtime UI updates
