# üîß R2 Configuration Fix - RESTART REQUIRED

## ‚úÖ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

**Problem:** R2 environment variables weren't being loaded properly in the React Native/Expo app.

**Root Cause:** Environment variables from `.env` files aren't automatically available in React Native unless properly exposed through the app configuration.

## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Updated app.config.js**
Added R2 environment variables to the `extra` configuration:
```javascript
extra: {
  // R2 Configuration  
  r2AccountId: process.env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID,
  r2AccessKeyId: process.env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  r2SecretAccessKey: process.env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  r2Endpoint: process.env.R2_ENDPOINT,
  r2PublicBucketName: process.env.R2_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME,
  r2PrivateBucketName: process.env.R2_PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME,
  r2PublicUrl: process.env.R2_PUBLIC_URL,
}
```

### 2. **Updated R2ConfigService.ts**
Changed from `process.env` to `Constants.expoConfig.extra`:
```typescript
// OLD: Direct process.env access (doesn't work in React Native)
const accountId = process.env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID;

// NEW: Expo Constants access (works in React Native)
const extra = Constants.expoConfig?.extra || {};
const accountId = extra.r2AccountId;
```

## üöÄ **RESTART REQUIRED**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You need to **restart the Expo development server** for these configuration changes to take effect.

### Steps:
1. **Stop the current Expo server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Restart with:** `npm start` or `expo start`
3. **Reload the app** on your device

## üéØ **Expected Result After Restart**

The R2 configuration error should be resolved and you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more "Missing or empty R2 environment variables" errors
- ‚úÖ R2ConfigService loads successfully  
- ‚úÖ Image upload proceeds to actual S3/R2 upload
- ‚úÖ Successful image upload to Cloudflare R2 storage

## üß™ **Test After Restart**

1. **Restart the Expo server**
2. **Reload the app** on your iPhone
3. **Try uploading an image** - it should now work completely!

The complete flow should now work:
1. ‚úÖ Image validation (fixed)
2. ‚úÖ Network check (bypassed) 
3. ‚úÖ R2 configuration (fixed)
4. ‚úÖ Successful upload to R2 storage

**After restart, your image uploads should work perfectly! üì∏‚ú®**
