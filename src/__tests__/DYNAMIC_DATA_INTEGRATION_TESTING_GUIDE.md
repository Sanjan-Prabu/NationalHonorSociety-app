  - No unauthorized data access

## Expected Behaviors

### Data Loading Patterns

1. **Initial Load**: Data should load within 2 seconds on good network
2. **Subsequent Loads**: Cached data should display immediately, then refresh
3. **Background Refresh**: Data should update automatically when app becomes active
4. **Offline Behavior**: Cached data should be available offline

### User Interface Responses

1. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens or spinners during data fetch
2. **Empty States**: Appropriate messages when no data exists
3. **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry options
4. **Success States**: Confirmation messages for successful operations

### Performance Expectations

1. **Memory Usage**: Should not exceed 100MB during normal operation
2. **Battery Impact**: Minimal battery drain from real-time subscriptions
3. **Network Usage**: Efficient data fetching with minimal redundant requests
4. **Storage Usage**: Reasonable cache sizes with automatic cleanup

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Data Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Screens show loading state indefinitely
**Possible Causes**:
- Network connectivity issues
- Database connection problems
- Authentication token expired
- RLS policies blocking access

**Solutions**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify authentication status
3. Check browser/app console for errors
4. Validate database permissions
5. Clear app cache and retry

#### Issue: Real-Time Updates Not Working
**Symptoms**: Changes don't appear immediately across screens
**Possible Causes**:
- Subscription connection failed
- WebSocket connection issues
- Client-side subscription cleanup problems

**Solutions**:
1. Check WebSocket connection status
2. Verify subscription setup in browser dev tools
3. Restart app to reinitialize subscriptions
4. Check Supabase real-time configuration

#### Issue: Permission Denied Errors
**Symptoms**: Users can't access expected data or features
**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect role assignment
- RLS policies too restrictive
- Organization context not set correctly

**Solutions**:
1. Verify user role in database
2. Check organization membership
3. Validate RLS policies
4. Ensure organization context is properly set

#### Issue: Performance Problems
**Symptoms**: Slow loading, high memory usage, battery drain
**Possible Causes**:
- Too many active subscriptions
