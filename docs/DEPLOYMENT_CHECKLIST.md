## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Triggers

#### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Rollback
- App crash rate > 5%
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption or loss
- BLE functionality completely broken
- Authentication system failure

#### Moderate Issues Requiring Planned Rollback
- BLE success rate < 80%
- Significant battery drain issues
- Major usability problems
- Performance degradation > 50%

### Rollback Process

#### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Hour)
```bash
# 1. Disable new user registrations (if needed)
# Update environment variable to stop new signups
eas env:set EXPO_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_ENABLED false --environment production

# 2. Enable maintenance mode (if needed)
eas env:set EXPO_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE true --environment production

# 3. Revert to previous stable build
eas build:list --limit 10
# Identify last known good build
eas submit --platform ios --id [PREVIOUS_BUILD_ID]
eas submit --platform android --id [PREVIOUS_BUILD_ID]
```

#### Database Rollback (If Required)
```sql
-- 1. Backup current state
pg_dump -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] > rollback_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

-- 2. Identify rollback point
SELECT version, applied_at FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations 
ORDER BY applied_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Rollback migrations if needed (EXTREME CAUTION)
-- Only rollback BLE-specific migrations, not core data
-- This should be rare and carefully planned
```

#### Feature Flag Rollback
```typescript
// Emergency feature disable
const BLE_FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  BLE_ENABLED: false, // Disable BLE entirely
  BLE_AUTO_ATTENDANCE: false, // Disable auto-attendance only
  BLE_BROADCASTING: false, // Disable officer broadcasting only
  BLE_SCANNING: false // Disable member scanning only
};

// Deploy feature flag update
eas update --branch production --message "Emergency BLE disable"
```

### Rollback Communication
