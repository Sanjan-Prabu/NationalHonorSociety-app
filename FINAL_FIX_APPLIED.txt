CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Sessions Will Now Appear!
================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Beacons were being detected but SKIPPED because organization context wasn't loaded yet.
The skipped beacons were NEVER cached, so reprocessing had nothing to work with.

THE FIX:
--------
1. Added skippedBeaconsCache to store beacons that arrive before org context loads
2. When org context loads, reprocess ALL skipped beacons
3. Removed autoAttendanceEnabled reference that was causing errors

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
File: modules/BLE/BLEContext.tsx
- Added: skippedBeaconsCache.current to store skipped beacons
- Modified: Organization context useEffect to reprocess skipped beacons
- Modified: handleAttendanceBeaconDetected to cache skipped beacons

File: src/screens/member/MemberBLEAttendanceScreen.tsx
- Removed: autoAttendanceEnabled console.log reference

HOW TO TEST:
------------
1. Reload the app (press 'r' in Metro)
2. Officer: Start BLE session
3. Member: Open BLE Attendance screen
4. Member: Tap "Scan for Sessions"

EXPECTED LOGS (Member):
-----------------------
[GlobalBLEManager] Beacon detected
[GlobalBLEManager] Organization context not yet loaded, caching beacon
[GlobalBLEManager] Cached beacon. Total skipped: 1
[GlobalBLEManager] Organization context loaded successfully
[GlobalBLEManager] Reprocessing 1 skipped beacons
[GlobalBLEManager] Reprocessing skipped beacon: major=2 minor=27972
[GlobalBLEManager] Found session: Kiro test
[GlobalBLEManager] ADDING SESSION TO DETECTED LIST

RESULT:
-------
Session will now appear in the "Detected Sessions" list!
You can then tap "Check In Now" to record attendance.

STATUS: READY TO TEST
