# Member Events Refresh Fix

## Problem
When members press refresh or swipe down to refresh in the events screen, events were not showing up properly even though they exist in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was with the event filtering logic in the member events screen:

1. **Strict date filtering**: The "Upcoming" filter was using `eventDate >= now` which excluded events from the current day
2. **Time precision**: The comparison was using exact timestamps instead of date-only comparison
3. **Organization context**: Events might not be loading due to organization context timing issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Date Filtering
**Before**: 
```typescript
return eventDate >= now; // Excluded events from today
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Set time to start of day for more inclusive comparison
now.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
return eventDate >= now; // Includes events from today onwards
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Before**:
```typescript
const onRefresh = async () => {
  await refreshEvents();
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const onRefresh = async () => {
  try {
    await refreshEvents();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error refreshing events:', error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to help troubleshoot refresh issues:
- **Total events fetched** from the database
- **Loading states** and error messages
- **Organization context** information
- **Filtered events count** and titles
- **Active filter** being applied

## How It Works Now

### Refresh Flow
1. **User swipes down** or presses refresh button
2. **RefreshControl triggers** `onRefresh()` function
3. **`refreshEvents()` called** from `useEventData` hook
4. **EventService.fetchEvents()** queries database with organization filter
5. **Events filtered** by selected timeframe (Upcoming/This Week/This Month)
6. **UI updates** with new events or shows empty state

### Event Filtering
- **Upcoming**: Shows events from today onwards (inclusive)
- **This Week**: Shows events within the current week
- **This Month**: Shows events within the current month

### Debug Information
The console now logs:
- How many events were fetched from the database
- How many events passed the filter
- Which organization the user belongs to
- Any loading or error states

## Expected Behavior

### When Events Exist
- ✅ **Refresh shows events** immediately
- ✅ **Proper filtering** by timeframe
- ✅ **Organization-scoped** events only
- ✅ **Real-time updates** when officers create/delete events

### When No Events Exist
- ✅ **Empty state** with appropriate message
- ✅ **Refresh still works** (shows loading then empty state)
- ✅ **No errors** in console

### Debug Output Example
```
MemberEventsScreen - Events data: {
  totalEvents: 5,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  organizationId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  organizationName: "Test National Honor Society"
}

MemberEventsScreen - Filtered events: {
  activeFilter: "Upcoming",
  totalEvents: 5,
  filteredEvents: 3,
  eventTitles: ["Beach Cleanup Day", "Leadership Workshop", "Annual Gala"]
}
```

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. **Create events** as an officer with future dates
2. **Switch to member view** 
3. **Pull down to refresh** - events should appear
4. **Check console logs** for debugging information
5. **Try different filters** (Upcoming/This Week/This Month)

The member events screen should now properly refresh and display events when they exist in the database.
