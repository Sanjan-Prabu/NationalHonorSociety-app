# React Native AWS SDK & R2 Public Access Fix

## Problems Fixed
1. **Buffer Error**: `Property 'Buffer' doesn't exist`
2. **Request Handler Error**: `requestHandler.handle is not a function`
3. **Image Preview Issue**: Gray boxes instead of images in EventCard
4. **R2 Public URL Configuration**: Incorrect public URL format

These errors occurred because:
- React Native doesn't have Node.js `Buffer` global by default
- AWS SDK's default request handler isn't compatible with React Native
- R2 public URL was using the S3 API endpoint instead of the public development URL
- Images couldn't be accessed directly due to incorrect URL format

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive React Native AWS SDK compatibility solution:

### 1. Installed Required Packages
```bash
npm install buffer @aws-sdk/fetch-http-handler
```

### 2. Created Buffer Polyfill Shim
Created `shims/buffer.js`:
- Imports the buffer package
- Makes Buffer available globally for React Native
- Provides web compatibility for Expo web builds

### 3. Updated Metro Configuration
Created `metro.config.js`:
- Added buffer alias resolution
- Ensures proper polyfill handling across platforms

### 4. Early Polyfill Loading
Added Buffer polyfill imports to:
- `index.ts` - Very early loading
- `App.tsx` - Application level loading

### 5. Fixed AWS SDK Request Handler
Updated `src/services/R2ConfigService.ts`:
- Added `import { FetchHttpHandler } from '@aws-sdk/fetch-http-handler'`
- Replaced invalid request handler with React Native-compatible `FetchHttpHandler`
- Added URL polyfill import for proper URL constructor support

### 6. Fixed R2 Public URL Configuration
Updated `.env` file:
- Changed `R2_PUBLIC_URL` from S3 API endpoint to public development URL
- Updated from `https://147322994f8cbee5b63de04ff2919a74.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/nhs-app-public-dev`
- To `https://pub-8eafccb788484d2db8560b92e1252627.r2.dev`

### 7. Explicit Import in ImageUploadService
Updated `src/services/ImageUploadService.ts`:
- Added explicit `import { Buffer } from 'buffer'`
- Ensures Buffer is available for base64 to binary conversion

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added buffer and @aws-sdk/fetch-http-handler dependencies
- `shims/buffer.js` - New polyfill file
- `metro.config.js` - New Metro configuration
- `index.ts` - Added polyfill import
- `App.tsx` - Added polyfill import
- `src/services/R2ConfigService.ts` - Fixed AWS SDK request handler + URL polyfill
- `src/services/ImageUploadService.ts` - Added explicit Buffer import + debug logging
- `.env` - Updated R2_PUBLIC_URL to correct public development URL
- `src/components/ui/LazyImage.tsx` - Fixed lazy loading logic for immediate display

## Testing
The fix resolves all errors and allows:
- ✅ Buffer operations for base64 to binary conversion
- ✅ Proper AWS SDK HTTP requests in React Native
- ✅ Successful image uploads to Cloudflare R2 storage
- ✅ Direct public access to uploaded images via correct R2 URLs
- ✅ Image previews display correctly in EventCard components
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)

## Impact
- ✅ Image uploads now work on iOS devices
- ✅ Image previews display correctly in events and announcements
- ✅ AWS SDK properly configured for React Native
- ✅ R2 public URLs work for direct image access
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains compatibility across all platforms
- ✅ Proper error handling preserved

## Key Technical Details
- **FetchHttpHandler**: Uses React Native's built-in fetch API instead of Node.js HTTP
- **Buffer Polyfill**: Provides Node.js Buffer functionality in React Native
- **URL Polyfill**: Ensures URL constructor works across all platforms
- **Metro Config**: Proper module resolution for polyfills
