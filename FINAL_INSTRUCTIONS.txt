BLE FIX - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
============================

STEP 1: Fix Database
--------------------
Run this command:

psql $DATABASE_URL < fix-ble-rls-simple.sql

This fixes RLS policies so members can insert attendance.


STEP 2: Rebuild App
-------------------
npm run ios -- --reset-cache


STEP 3: Test
------------
Officer:
1. Login -> Officer Attendance
2. Enter title + duration
3. Tap "Start BLE Session"
4. Watch attendee count

Member:
1. Login -> BLE Attendance
2. Tap "Scan for Sessions"
3. Tap "Check In Now"
4. Verify success


WHAT WAS FIXED
--------------
1. Removed auto-attendance feature
2. Manual check-in button always visible
3. Real-time attendee count (updates every 10 seconds)
4. Database RLS policies fixed


FILES CHANGED
-------------
- modules/BLE/BLEContext.tsx
- src/screens/member/MemberBLEAttendanceScreen.tsx
- src/screens/officer/OfficerAttendanceScreen.tsx
- src/types/ble.ts


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If check-in fails:
  - Re-run the SQL script
  - Check console for errors

If sessions don't appear:
  - Check Bluetooth enabled
  - Check location permission
  - Check same organization


That's it! The code is ready and compiles without errors.
