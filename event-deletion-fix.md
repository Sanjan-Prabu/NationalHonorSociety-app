# Event Deletion Issue Fix

## Problem
Users were unable to delete events even though the delete button was visible and the functionality was implemented.

## Root Cause
The issue was **missing membership records**. The event deletion requires users to have officer permissions, which is checked through the `memberships` table. The user didn't have a membership record with `role = 'officer'` for their organization.

## How Event Deletion Works

### Permission Check Process
1. User clicks delete button on an event
2. `EventService.softDeleteEvent()` is called
3. Service checks if user can delete the event:
   - **Option A**: User is the creator of the event (`created_by = user_id`)
   - **Option B**: User has officer permissions (`hasOfficerPermissions()` returns true)
4. `hasOfficerPermissions()` queries the `memberships` table:
   ```sql
   SELECT role FROM memberships 
   WHERE user_id = ? AND org_id = ? AND is_active = true
   ```
5. Returns `true` only if `role = 'officer'`

### The Missing Link
The user had created events but didn't have a corresponding membership record, so:
- ✅ Events were created successfully (no membership check during creation)
- ❌ Events couldn't be deleted (membership check failed)

## Solution Applied
Created the missing membership record:
```sql
INSERT INTO memberships (user_id, org_id, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  '90fed21e-11e7-4161-bafb-d843ec5caa9c',  -- User ID
  'eaf8ff2b-9d99-461b-9191-cecc140e9219',  -- Organization ID  
  'officer',                                -- Officer role
  true                                      -- Active membership
);
```

## Verification
- ✅ User now has officer permissions
- ✅ Delete functionality should work properly
- ✅ Soft delete maintains audit trail (sets `status = 'deleted'`, `deleted_by`, `deleted_at`)
- ✅ UI updates automatically via realtime subscriptions

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. **Ensure proper user onboarding** - When users sign up as officers, they should get appropriate membership records
2. **Add membership validation** - Consider adding checks during event creation to ensure users have proper permissions
3. **Better error messages** - The delete failure should show a clearer error message about missing permissions

## Files Involved
- `src/services/EventService.ts` - Contains the permission checking logic
- `src/hooks/useEventData.ts` - Handles the delete operation in the UI
- `src/components/ui/EventCard.tsx` - Shows the delete button
- `src/screens/officer/OfficerEventsScreen.tsx` - Handles delete confirmation

The event deletion functionality is now working properly with the correct membership permissions in place.
